# Getting started
1. Install the project dependencies with either
### pnpm (preferred as the repo already contains a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file)
```shell
pnpm i
```
or
### with yarn
```shell
yarn
```
or
### with npm
```shell
npm i
```
2. Run the project accordingly with the following:

```shell
pnpm dev
```
or
```shell
yarn dev
```
or
```shell
npm run dev
```
